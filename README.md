# road_to_middle

The repository you are in, as stated in description, represents my achievements on competencies that are to be obtained to get promoted to Middle DevOps Engineer position in the company I've been working at the time of writing the article.

Feel free to check the subrepos of interest. I meant to have an individual README for each of it so that you have a clear understanding on what in the name of God is going on here.
