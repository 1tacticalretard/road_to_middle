# road_to_moddle -- Terraform subrepo

What do we have here is (surprise surprise) my work on Terraform manifests, modules, and related infrastructure stuff.

## Table of contents

### tests - basically a folder where a test manifests are present. Any sort of novelty comes here and being tested firstly.

### modules - the folder for modules. Currently consists of:
* [roadtomiddle_aws_networking](#roadtomiddle_aws_networking) - a highly customizable, self-written module for creating a simple, yet reliable network configuration for my infrastructure.
